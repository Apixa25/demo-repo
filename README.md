## Implimentation of Web Accessibilty Standards 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://apixa25.github.io/horiseon-web-accessibility/)

Web accessibility standards are a list of ideals for making Web content more accessible.  The ideals are that the site be as Perceivable, Operable, and Understandable as possible. Especially taking into consideration people with special needs, and users with limited devices such as mobile phones instead of desk-tops. The purpose is to make the web-page as user friendly for everyone as possible, on every device possible. we

I was given an existing page for a fictitious company "Horiseon". In this exercise the client did not want the general look of the site to change. So no changes to graphic elements or their behavior were modified. 

In order to make the site more accessible HTML elements were modified so that e-readers and the use of assistive hearing devices would work better.  This was done by correctly labeling the structure of the site.  Specifically moving away from non-semantic to semantic elements.  Semantic elements are those that actually say what they're doing.  Such as declaring "sections" and "asides" instead of just making undefined spaces in the code.

The HTML was also fixed so that heading attributes, which screen readers rely on, were made to identify themselves clearly and put in sequential order so that the site makes sense if someone were to perceive it in a way other than seeing it.

For the images of the page Alt attributes were added to every image.  An alt atribute specify text for an image.  This can be useful if a person cannot see the image itself or if the page is being read by screen readers.  

Next the CSS stylesheet was gone through and inefficiencies were looked for and corrected.  There were several places where the CSS was redundant.  If not fixed this can cause the page to load slower than necessary.
