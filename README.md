## Implimentation of Web Accessibilty Standards 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://apixa25.github.io/demo-repo/)

Web accessibilty standards are a list of ideals for making Web content more accessable.  The ideals are that the site be as Perceivable, Operable, and understandable as possible. Especilly taking into consideration people with special needs, and users with limited devices such as mobile phones instead of desk-tops. The purpose is to make the web-page as user friendly for everyone as possible, on every device possible. 

I was given an existing page for a fictitous company "Horiseon". In this excercise the client did not want the general look of the site to change. So no changes to graphic elements or their behavior were modified. 

In order to make the site more accessible HTML elements were modified so that e-readers and the use of assitive hearing devices would work better.  This was done by correctly labeling the structure of the site.  Specifically moving away from non-semantic to semantic elements.  Semantic elements are those that actually say what their doing.  Such as declaring "sections" and "asides" instead of just making undefined spaces in the code.

The HTML was also fixed so that heading attributes, which screen readers rely on, were made to identify themselves clearly and put in sequential order so that the site makes sense if someone were to perceive it in a way other than seeing it.

For the images of the page Alt atributes were added to every image.  An alt atribute specify text for an image.  This can be usefull if a person cannont see the image itself or if the page is being read by screen readers.  











Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile‚Äîand one that many new developers often overlook‚Äîis the README.md file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 

Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Code Refactor Example](#code-refactor-example)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Learning Points](#learning-points)
* [Author Info](#author-info)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Code Refactor Example

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


```html
<div class="header">
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
```

Converting the above non-semantic div with the class of 'header' to an appropriate [<header> semantic element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp). 

```html
<header>
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

```

This change require some additional modification to the CSS selector: 

```css
.header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #2a607c;
    color: #ffffff;
}
```

No longer targeting the element on the page with the class of 'header' but instead the css selector targeting the 'header' element 

```css
header {
    padding: 20px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #2a607c;
    color: #ffffff;
}

```

## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
```


## Learning Points 


This is a good place to Explain what you Learned by creating this application.
This is a great way to remind about all of the Complex Skills you now have.
If the user is less experienced than you:
They will be impressed by what you can do!

If the user is more experienced than you:
They will be impressed by what you can do!

Remember, it is easy to forget exactly how Valuable and Impressive your skills are, as well as How Much You‚Äôve Learned!
So quantify that here!

The user has looked through your whole README, and gotten familiar with your application. 
This is where you take credit, and make it easy for them to learn more about you!
Direct them to the following:
- Your GitHub Profile
- Your LinkedIn
- Your Portfolio Website
- And Anything Else You Want!

Give credit where credit is due! 

If you Pseudocode or Pair Program with someone else, give them kudos in your Contributors section!


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.


## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
